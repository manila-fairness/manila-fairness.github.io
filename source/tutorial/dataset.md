# 1. Obtain the dataset

First, you need to obtain the dataset. In this tutorial, we will use the COMPAS dataset. The dataset can be downloaded [here](../_static/compas.csv).

At this time, MANILA supports only tabular datasets in different formats (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.). The format of the dataset can be specified from the interface of MANILA.
